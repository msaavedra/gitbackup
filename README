A script to back up git repositories easily.

This was designed specifically for use in backing up safely to Dropbox,
though it can be used to back up to any path in your filesystem (ie, a mounted
SMB, NFS or SSHFS remote networked directory).

This script is suitable to be run as a cron job or from the git post-commit
hook. It is careful not to do anything destructive, and skips git
repositories where there are problems. It reports any such errors on stderr.

Another useful setup is to run gitbackup from the git post-commit hook.

Run "gitbackup.py --help" for full directions. The basic command that will work
for most uses is:

gitbackup.py ~/Projects/* ~/Dropbox/gitbackups
